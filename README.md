# Bloxorz AI

## Overview
This repository contains an AI solver for the popular puzzle game Bloxorz. 
The solver uses graph search algorithms to find the optimal path to move the rectangular block to the destination hole. 
The project is written in Python and employs algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth First Search (DFS), Best First Search (BFS), and A* to efficiently solve the game levels.
